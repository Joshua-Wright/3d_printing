My various configs for 3D printing

Currently, I have a CR-10S with a supervolcano hotend running Marlin 1.1.9

It looks like I can print about 150mm/s at least with the titan screw tightened almost all the way, and the temp at 210C. Models printed this fast won't work well though because there isn't enough cooling.
